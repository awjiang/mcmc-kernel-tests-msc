# Kernel Tests for Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods 
MSc Dissertation in Computational Statistics and Machine Learning at UCL

## Abstract
In Bayesian statistics, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms provide flexible ways to sample from analytically intractable posterior distributions. However, inference based on MCMC methods suffers from two sources of error: lack of convergence and mistakes in implementation. While there are a variety of methods to detect the former, less attention has been devoted to the latter. We propose two two-sample tests for diagnosing MCMC implementation errors based on Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). The MMD tests exhibit lower Type I/II error rates than the commonly used [Geweke test](http://qed.econ.queensu.ca/pub/faculty/ferrall/quant/papers/04_04_29_geweke.pdf) and perform competitively with recently proposed alternatives in several experiments. On the other hand, the computational costs of both MMD tests are quadratic in the number of observations compared to linear or log-linear for existing tests. Finally, we provide some evidence that, unlike existing alternatives, the MMD tests generalize well to domains other than $\mathbb{R}^{d}$.
